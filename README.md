Hi! 👋  
This repository contains a complete **Digital Transformation Strategy** case study for **CareLink**, a real-time seizure detection & family escalation platform designed for vulnerable adolescents living away from home.

The project was created as part of **HCI 544 – Digital Transformation Strategy** at Arizona State University and includes:

- Problem framing & unmet clinical need  
- Digital health solution design (CareLink)  
- Wearable + cloud integration  
- Stakeholder & governance analysis  
- IT governance & risk model  
- Performance & KPI design  
- Change management & implementation roadmap  

## 🚨 What CareLink Solves  
Every year, uncontrolled epilepsy causes:

- Delayed first aid in **70%+** of adolescent seizures  
- Increased injury, hospitalization & SUDEP risk  
- Poor communication between peers, families & clinicians  
- Lack of structured escalation workflows in hostels/dorms  

CareLink closes this gap through **real-time seizure alerts**, **family escalation**, **peer-to-peer fallback**, and **EHR-integrated follow-ups**.
